Upon absorbing Androids 17 and 18, he transforms into his Perfect Form, significantly boosting his power level and abilities. In his Perfect Form, Cell is able to challenge and surpass many of the Z Fighters, even pushing Gohan to achieve Super Saiyan 2. During the Cell Games, he exhibits further growth by regenerating from near-death experiences, showing his adaptability and resilience. Ultimately, Gohan defeats him, but Cell's journey is marked by his rapid evolution, strategic intelligence, and ability to integrate the strengths of various fighters into his own arsenal.</td>

He is the latest of Universe 7's Legendary Super Saiyans, demonic Saiyan warriors who appear every 1,000 years. Because of his power level that was said to exceed that of Prince Vegeta's, he was stranded on the planet Vampa by King Vegeta, where he was raised by his father until being rescued 48 years later by Cheelai and Lemo of the Frieza Force.</td>
                <td>Broly's power level journey begins in "Dragon Ball Z: Broly – The Legendary Super Saiyan" and is further developed in "Dragon Ball Super: Broly."

His base form is already incredibly strong, but his true power emerges when he transforms into the Legendary Super Saiyan, a form characterized by immense strength and a berserk fighting style. In this form, he easily overpowers Goku, Vegeta, and other Z Fighters. In "Dragon Ball Super: Broly," his backstory is revised, and his power is shown to grow exponentially during battles. After being found and recruited by Frieza, Broly fights Goku and Vegeta, demonstrating his base form's power and rapidly evolving strength. As the battle progresses, he ascends to a Wrathful state, tapping into the Great Ape's power without transforming, and eventually reaches a new, more controlled version of the Legendary Super Saiyan form. His power continues to grow during the fight, pushing Goku and Vegeta to fuse into Gogeta to defeat him. Broly's journey is marked by his raw, overwhelming power and potential for limitless growth, driven by his Saiyan heritage and intense emotions, making him one of the most formidable characters in the "Dragon Ball" series.</td>
